Kaggle, the home of data science, provides a global platform for competitions, customer solutions and job board. Here’s the Kaggle catch, these competitions not only make you think out of the box, but also offers a handsome prize money.
Yet, people hesitate to participate in these competitions. Here are some major reasons:
-They belittle their level of skills, knowledge and techniques acquired.
-Irrespective of their level of skill sets, they choose the problem offering highest prize money.
-They fail to equivocate their level of skill set with the difficulty level of problem.
I reckon, this issue emanates for Kaggle itself. Kaggle.com doesn’t provide any information which can help people to choose the most appropriate problem matching with their skill set. As a result, it has become an arduous task for beginners/intermediates to decide for suitable problem to begin.
